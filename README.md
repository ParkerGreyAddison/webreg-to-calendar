# webreg-to-calendar
Obligatory UCSD webreg-to-calendar, this time as a Firefox add-on!

Basic idea:
- support webreg page and MyTritonLink page
- scrape the schedule blocks from the page
- parse the scrape and convert to a calendar file (importing a file would be better than getting permission to modify google cal)
- done
